The Income Page

The income page is where you can see how our current rental income compares to our projected expenses.

The page also shows proposed changes to rents.  You can compare the percentage increases different leaseholders have proposed.  If you're the admin person for a lease you can also change the proposed rent for that lease.

The default increase shown is the percent increase in rental income we'd need to meet our projected core expenses.  If every leaseholder agrees to increase their rent by this amount, we'll generate enough rent to cover our core expenses.

The Expense Page

The expense page is where you can allocate funds to different expenses, and propose new expenses.

You can vote on as many expenses as you want, and you can change your vote at any time.  If you choose not to vote, your share of the allocation will be divided equally between those who do vote.

Each vote you place has three parts:

* Rank
* Weight
* Optionally, a funding limit

See the help page for details about how these are used to determine allocation of funds.
